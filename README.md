# 🌟 Quannex - The Living Geometric Oracle

**A revolutionary organizational intelligence system that transforms complex business data into a living, breathing 3D visualization of coherence and harmony.**

## 🎯 Vision

Quannex is more than a dashboard—it's a **living geometric oracle** that reveals the hidden patterns of organizational health through the sacred geometry of a dodecahedron. Each face, edge, and vertex carries meaning, creating a multi-sensory experience that allows leaders to intuitively understand their organization's coherence and discover the highest-leverage actions for transformation.

## ✨ What We've Built

### 🏗️ **Complete Architecture (100% Functional)**

#### **Backend: The Coherence Engine** 
- **Sophisticated Data Models**: Complete implementation of KPI, Face, Edge, Vertex, and Dodecahedron classes
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Harmonic resonance calculations, vortex dynamics, and coherence metrics
- **Comprehensive API**: 8 REST endpoints for real-time system interaction
- **Sample Data**: Rich organizational dataset with 60 KPIs across 12 domains

#### **Frontend: The Living Visualization**
- **3D Dodecahedron**: Interactive Three.js visualization with dynamic coloring
- **Real-time Updates**: Live connection to backend with smooth animations
- **Intuitive Controls**: KPI selection and update interface
- **Coherence Dashboard**: Global metrics, action plans, and system insights

### 🎨 **Key Features**

1. **Dynamic Face Coloring**: Each of the 12 faces changes color based on organizational domain health
2. **Vertex Vortices**: 20 vertices show transformation potential through size and color
3. **Edge Tensions**: 30 edges reveal relationship stress between domains
4. **Global Coherence**: Real-time organizational health percentage
5. **Action Intelligence**: AI-driven recommendations for highest-impact interventions
6. **Interactive KPI Updates**: Select any KPI and watch the entire system respond
7. **🧬 Octave Helix Spiral**: DNA-inspired double helix visualization showing organizational evolution through 7 developmental stages

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo>
   cd dodecahedron-code
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
   You should see:
   ```
   🌟 QUANNEX COHERENCE ENGINE 🌟
   ✨ Server running on http://localhost:3001
   📊 System loaded with 12 faces, 30 edges, 20 vertices
   🎯 Initial Global Coherence: XX.X%
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend (Terminal 2)**

   ```

### 🎮 **How to Use**

1. **Launch the System**: Open your browser to the frontend URL
2. **Watch the Oracle Load**: The dodecahedron will fetch live data and display organizational coherence
3. **Explore the Visualization**:
   - **Faces**: Color indicates domain health (green=healthy, yellow=warning, red=critical)
   - **Vertices**: Size shows transformation potential, color shows direction
   - **Edges**: Color reveals relationship tension between domains
4. **Update KPIs**: Use the dropdown to select any KPI and enter a new value
5. **Watch the Magic**: See how a single change ripples through the entire system
6. **Read Action Plans**: The system recommends the highest-leverage interventions
7. **🧬 Explore Octave Helix**: Open `octave-helix-spiral.html` to see your developmental spiral

### 🎛️ **Controls**

- **Space**: Pause/Resume rotation
- **R**: Refresh data from backend
- **H**: Hide/Show control panel
- **+/-**: Adjust rotation speed
- **🔄 Refresh Button**: Manually reload system state
- **KPI Dropdown**: Select and update any organizational metric
- **🧬 Octave Helix Page**: Visualize organizational progression through developmental octaves

## 🏛️ **System Architecture**

### **The 12 Faces (Organizational Domains)**
1. **Vision & Strategy** - The Seer
2. **Leadership & Governance** - The Conductor  
3. **People & Culture** - The Gardener
4. **Operations & Execution** - The Builder
5. **Financial Health** - The Steward
6. **Customer Experience** - The Servant
7. **Technology & Innovation** - The Alchemist
8. **Communication & Transparency** - The Messenger
9. **Risk & Compliance** - The Guardian
10. **Partnerships & Ecosystem** - The Weaver
11. **Sustainability & Impact** - The Steward of Earth
12. **Learning & Adaptation** - The Sage

### **The 30 Edges (Relationships)**
Each edge represents the flow and tension between two organizational domains, with its own KPI measuring relationship health.

### **The 20 Vertices (Transformation Points)**
Convergence points where three domains meet, representing leverage points for organizational change.

### 🎵 **The 7 Octaves (Developmental Stages)**

The system now maps organizational consciousness through 7 evolutionary stages:

1. **O1 - Survival** (Focus: Existence) - "Do we have it?"
2. **O2 - Structure** (Focus: Stability) - "Is it organized?"
3. **O3 - Relationships** (Focus: Connection) - "Are we connected?"
4. **O4 - Creativity** (Focus: Possibility) - "Can we innovate?"
5. **O5 - Expression** (Focus: Clarity) - "Are we authentic?"
6. **O6 - Vision** (Focus: Direction) - "Do we serve a greater purpose?"
7. **O7 - Radiance** (Focus: Service) - "Are we a gift to the world?"

Each organizational domain (face) progresses through these stages with its own KPIs.

### 🧬 **The Double Helix Spiral**

A revolutionary visualization metaphor:
- **Main spiral (ball helix)**: Represents the primary KPI progression through octaves
- **5 elemental pillars**: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Ether - show relationship quality
- **Color coding**: Green (healthy) → Yellow (good) → Orange (warning) → Red (critical)
- **Navigation**: Select any of 12 faces and watch how it evolves

**Try it**: Open `octave-helix-spiral.html` after starting the backend!

## 🔧 **API Endpoints**

- `GET /api/health` - System health check
- `GET /api/state` - Complete system state
- `POST /api/update_kpi` - Update a KPI value
- `GET /api/kpis` - All KPIs
- `GET /api/faces` - All faces with energies
- `GET /api/edges` - All edges with tensions
- `GET /api/vertices` - All vertices with vortex data
- `GET /api/action-plan` - Current coherence recommendations
- `POST /api/reset` - Reset to initial state

## 🧬 **The Mathematics of Coherence**

### **Face Energy Calculation**
```
E_face = E_base × (1 + 0.3 × R_harmonic)
```
Where R_harmonic is calculated using pentagram geometry to measure how well the 5 elemental KPIs work together.

### **Global Coherence**
```
Coherence = 0.4 × AvgFaceEnergy + 0.3 × AvgEdgeHealth + 0.3 × AvgVertexCoherence
```

### **Vortex Dynamics**
Each vertex calculates transformation potential based on the variance and mean of its three converging face energies.

## 🎨 **Customization**

### **Adding New KPIs**
Edit `backend/data/sampleData.js` to add new KPIs to any face:

```javascript
new KPI({
  id: 'F1_K6',
  name: 'Your New Metric',
  direction: '↑', // '↑', '↓', or 'Band'
  healthyMin: 60,
  healthyMax: 100,
  value: 75,
  weight: 1.0,
  faceId: 1,
  primaryOctave: 'Vision'
})
```

### **Modifying Visualization**
- **Colors**: Edit the color calculation functions in each model class
- **Geometry**: Modify the Three.js setup in `main.js`
- **UI**: Update `index.html` and `style.css`

## 🔮 **The Philosophy**

Quannex embodies the principle that **organizations are living systems** with their own patterns of health and disease. By mapping these patterns onto sacred geometry, we create an instrument that allows leaders to:

- **See the Whole**: Understand systemic patterns beyond individual metrics
- **Feel the Flow**: Intuitively grasp organizational dynamics
- **Find the Leverage**: Identify the single action with maximum impact
- **Dance with Change**: Work with natural organizational rhythms

## 🌟 **Achievement Status: 100% Complete**

✅ **Sprint 1**: Data Foundation - All core classes implemented  
✅ **Sprint 2**: Coherence Engine - Full calculation logic working  
✅ **Sprint 3**: API Bridge - Complete REST API functional  
✅ **Sprint 4**: Living Visualization - Dynamic 3D rendering complete  
✅ **Sprint 5**: The Dance - Real-time feedback loop implemented  

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Backend Won't Start**
- Ensure you're in the `backend` directory
- Check that port 3001 is available
- Verify Node.js is installed: `node --version`

### **Frontend Shows "Offline Mode"**
- Confirm backend is running on http://localhost:3001
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Try refreshing with the 🔄 button

### **KPI Updates Don't Work**
- Verify backend API is responding: visit http://localhost:3001/api/health
- Check browser network tab for failed requests
- Ensure KPI values are within valid ranges

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

The core vision is **100% complete**! Possible enhancements:
- Historical data tracking and trends
- Multiple organization comparison
