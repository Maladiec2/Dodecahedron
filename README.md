## 🎯 What Is This?

**Quannex** measures organizational health not as isolated KPIs, but as **coherence** - how well all parts work together.

### **The Core Innovation**

Traditional dashboards show you 60 numbers. Quannex shows you **1 dodecahedron** that breathes with your organization's rhythm.

**Key Concepts:**
- **12 Faces** = 12 organizational domains (Finance, People, Operations, etc.)
- **5 Elements per Face** = Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Ether (pentagram geometry)
- **6 Breath Axes** = Balanced flow between complementary domains
- **7 Octaves** = Developmental stages (Survival → Radiance)
- **Golden Ratio (φ)** = Natural proportions throughout

### **Why Sacred Geometry?**

Because organizations are **living systems**, not machines. The dodecahedron (12-faced Platonic solid) naturally maps to:
- Holistic thinking (all parts visible)
- Relational harmony (edges connect faces)
- Transformation potential (vertices as leverage points)

## 🧬 The 7 Octaves

Organizations evolve through 7 developmental stages:

| Octave | Name | Focus | Question |
|--------|------|-------|----------|
| **O1** | Survival | Existence | "Do we have it?" |
| **O2** | Structure | Stability | "Is it organized?" |
| **O3** | Relationships | Connection | "Are we connected?" |
| **O4** | Creativity | Possibility | "Can we innovate?" |
| **O5** | Expression | Clarity | "Are we authentic?" |
| **O6** | Vision | Direction | "Do we serve a greater purpose?" |
| **O7** | Radiance | Service | "Are we a gift to the world?" |

**The Quannex Story:** We're operating at O1-O2 (survival/structure) while holding O6-O7 vision. This "Aspiration-Actuality Gap" is measurable in our DNA helix.

## 🎓 Academic Context

This POC was developed for a **Bachelor's thesis** exploring how sacred geometry and systems theory can create a new paradigm for organizational measurement.

**Research Questions:**
1. Can sacred geometry encode relational wisdom into organizational metrics?
2. Does pentagram analysis reveal harmony patterns traditional KPIs miss?
3. Can breath dynamics predict burnout and stagnation before they manifest?

**Status:** 85% complete, targeting February 2026 defense

## 🌟 Philosophy

> "We are building more than a dashboard. We are building a living, geometric oracle—a real-time coherence engine that reveals the hidden patterns of organizational health through sacred geometry."

**Core Principles:**
- **Harmony over Power** - Variance penalties favor balanced growth
- **Natural Proportions** - Golden ratio (φ = 1.618) throughout
- **Breath Balance** - Sustainable organizations inhale and exhale in rhythm
- **Elemental Wisdom** - All 5 elements must thrive together
- **Conscious Evolution** - Track developmental stages, not just metrics
