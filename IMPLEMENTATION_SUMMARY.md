## 🎯 Key Capabilities

### 1. **Shadow Detection**
The system now automatically detects 6 archetypal patterns:
- Brittle Profit
- Extractive Growth
- Experience Gap
- Burnout Engine
- Hollow Governance
- Lonely Hero

When detected, face energies are automatically penalized to reveal the true cost.

### 2. **Breath Monitoring**
The 6 harmonic axes are continuously monitored:
- Resource Flow (Money)
- Substance & Story (Knowledge)
- Being & Doing (Work)
- Form & Integrity (Structure)
- Perception & Truth (Values)
- Network & Fortress (Boundaries)

Each axis shows if you're:
- **Over-exhaling** (depleting, risk of burnout)
- **Over-inhaling** (stagnating, missed opportunities)
- **Balanced** (healthy rhythm)

### 3. **Tuning Adjustment**
You can now adjust the fundamental behavior of the system:

- **α (alpha):** How much you believe in synergy vs averages
- **β (beta):** Symmetry of influences
- **γ (gamma):** Internal vs relational accountability
- **δ (delta):** Local vs shadow awareness
- **κ (kappa):** System sensitivity/responsiveness

### 4. **Elemental Flow**
Edges now behave differently based on their nature:
- **Fire edges:** Amplify tension (×1.3)
- **Air edges:** Accelerate flow (×1.1)
- **Water edges:** Smooth and dampen (×0.9)
- **Earth edges:** Stabilize and ground (×0.8)
- **Ether edges:** Neutral (×1.0)

## 🎨 Color Coding in UI

### Shadow Analysis
- 🟢 **Green** (≥80%): Good integrity
- 🟠 **Orange** (60-80%): Concerning patterns
- 🔴 **Red** (<60%): Critical hypocrisy

### Breath Analysis
- 🟢 **Green** (≥80%): Excellent breath health
- 🟡 **Yellow** (60-80%): Good balance
- 🟠 **Orange** (40-60%): Concerning imbalance
- 🔴 **Red** (<40%): Critical breath disruption

### Being-Action Balance
- 🟢 **Green** (80-120%): Balanced
- 🟠 **Orange** (>120%): Over-inhaling
- 🔴 **Red** (<80%): Over-exhaling

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Detect Burnout Engine
1. Update F8 (Core Operations) to 0.9 (very high)
2. Update F3 (Human Capital) to 0.2 (very low)
3. Check `/api/shadow-analysis` - should detect "Burnout Engine"
4. Check `/api/breath-analysis` - "Being & Doing" axis should show "over-exhaling"
5. Observe UI - Shadow panel shows pattern detected

### Scenario 2: Adjust System Sensitivity
1. Call `GET /api/tuning-constants` - see default κ=4.0
2. Update a KPI - observe current responsiveness
3. Call `POST /api/tuning-constants` with κ=6.0 (more sensitive)
4. Update same KPI - observe increased responsiveness
5. Call `POST /api/tuning-constants` with κ=2.0 (gentler)
6. Update same KPI - observe dampened response

### Scenario 3: Monitor Breath Cycles
1. Open frontend
2. Watch "🌊 Breath Analysis" panel
3. Increase Financial Capital (F1) significantly
4. Breath ratio on "Resource Flow" axis should show "over-inhaling"
5. Increase Funding Pipeline (F11) to match
6. Breath ratio should return to balanced

## 🎓 What Makes This Special

### 1. **Philosophical Depth**
This isn't just metrics - it's an ontology. The system embodies claims about:
- How organizations work (geometric, harmonic)
- What health means (coherence, integrity, breath)
- How change happens (modal, elemental, rhythmic)

### 2. **Mathematical Sophistication**
- Graph Laplacians and eigenvalue decomposition
- Pentagram geometric analysis
- Logistic response functions
- Elemental modulation

### 3. **Ethical Awareness**
The Shadow Penalty system gives the oracle a conscience - it can detect and call out hypocrisy.

### 4. **Breathwork Analogy**
The Breath Analysis makes organizational dynamics tangible through the universal experience of breathing.

### 5. **Tunability**
The α, β, γ, δ, κ parameters mean the system can adapt to different organizational philosophies and stages.
