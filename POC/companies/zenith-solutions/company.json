  "story": "Zenith Solutions has cracked the codeâ€”they have real product-market fit, paying Fortune 500 customers, and a world-class engineering team. After 3 years of grinding, they raised a solid Series A and are now scaling fast. But success brings new problems. They're signing customers faster than they can onboard them. Engineering ships 9 features per month but documentation lags behind. The team grew from 12 to 45 people in 8 months, and culture is fraying. Founders are drowning in decision-making. Classic Series A scaling pain: they've proven the product works, now they need to prove the company can scale.",

They're winning in the market but accumulating organizational debt. Need to pause external push and invest 6 months in foundations before next growth phase."
