  "story": "Nova Tech is fighting for its life. Three technical founders and two contractors built an AI marketing platform that genuinely works—but they're burning through their seed funding at an unsustainable rate. With only $28K in the bank and $67K monthly burn, they have 4 months to either raise more funding or achieve revenue. Founders are sleeping 4 hours a night, product uptime is 87.5%, and they have zero paying customers. The technology is brilliant. The execution is chaotic. The future is uncertain.",

    "insight": "Severe imbalance. Nova is projecting energy desperately (fundraising, building) but not receiving anything back (no revenue, no rest, no customers). Classic death spiral. Without dramatic intervention—funding or revenue—they will not survive."
