KPI formula for BAND (platrau-aware),"=IF(AND(Value >= Healthy_Min, Value <= Healthy_Max), 1, IF(Value < Healthy_Min, (Value - Target_Min) / (Healthy_Min - Target_Min), 1 - (Value - Healthy_Max) / (Absolute_Max - Healthy_Max)))",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. The ? (Up is Better) Formula,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This formula remains the same, as it is simple and robust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Required Columns: Value, Target_Min, Target_Ideal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Formula: =MAX(0, MIN(1, (Value - Target_Min) / (Target_Ideal - Target_Min)))",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Example (% Thesis Drafted): With Value=50, Min=0, Ideal=100, the score is (50-0)/(100-0) = 0.5. Perfect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. The ? (Down is Better) Formula,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is the inverse of the ""Up is Better"" formula.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Required Columns: Value, Target_Min (this now represents the ""dangerously high"" number), Target_Ideal (this represents the perfect ""low"" score).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Formula: =MAX(0, MIN(1, 1 - ((Value - Target_Ideal) / (Target_Min - Target_Ideal))))",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Example (Process Error Rate):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Value = 3 (3 errors per week),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Target_Ideal = 1 (The goal is 1 error or less),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Target_Min = 10 (10 errors is the ""catastrophe"" point)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Calculation: 1 - ((3 - 1) / (10 - 1)) = 1 - (2 / 9) = 1 - 0.22 = 0.78.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Interpretation: A score of 0.78 makes sense. You are not at the ideal, but you are much closer to the ideal (1) than to the catastrophe point (10).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Required Columns: Value, Target_Min, Healthy_Min, Healthy_Max, Absolute_Max.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Perfected Formula:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"=IF(AND(VALUE >= Healthy_Min, VALUE <= Healthy_Max), 1, IF(VALUE < Healthy_Min, MAX(0, (VALUE - Target_Min) / (Healthy_Min - Target_Min)), MAX(0, 1 - (VALUE - Healthy_Max) / (Absolute_Max - Healthy_Max))))",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
