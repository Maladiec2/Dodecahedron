?_dept (Dept. Coherence Penalty),0.3,"The ""variance penalty"" multipliers in your SYSTEM_COHERENCE sheet",(Controls sensitivity to intra-departmental harmony),"They answer the question: ""How much do we value harmony over raw power?""","A low ? (e.g., 0.1) reflects a ""growth-at-all-costs"" mindset. It rewards high average scores, even if they are ""jagged"" and unsustainable. A high ? (e.g., 0.9) reflects the philosophy of a master conductor. It will severely punish a high average score if it comes from a dissonant, unbalanced system. It prioritizes the beauty of the music over the volume of the sound.","(0.3, 0.25, 0.25): These are wise, moderate starting points. They state a clear preference for harmony without being overly punitive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

? (Alpha): The Synergy Blend (Pentagram Mean/Product Blend) ,0.6,The constant in the Star Pair Values (s?) formula,(Blends arithmetic and multiplicative synergy),"It answers the question: ""When two KPIs interact, is their combined effect a simple average (?=1.0) or is there a multiplicative synergy (?=0.0)?""","A high ? (e.g., 0.8) reflects a pragmatic, cautious view, trusting the simple average. A low ? (e.g., 0.3) reflects a belief in non-linear effects, where two strong KPIs together create an effect far greater than their sum.","(0.6): This is a beautiful, balanced choice. It says, ""We believe in synergy, but we will ground it in a pragmatic reality.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
? (Beta) The Intersection Blend (Pentagram Intersection Blend),0.5,The constant in the Intersection Nodes (p?) formula,(Balances the influence of adjacent star-pairs),"It determines how much influence adjacent ""star pairs"" have on each other. A ? of 0.5 gives them equal influence.","Changing this from 0.5 would represent a belief that the ""flow of influence"" around the pentagram is not symmetrical. It is an advanced and subtle tuning.","(0.5): This is the perfect, default choice. It assumes a state of balanced, symmetrical influence, which is the most coherent starting point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"? (Gamma): The ""Ball and Pillars"" (Pentagram Pillar/Ball Blend)",0.7,"The constant in our old Nuanced Avg. Pillar Health formula, but we can re-purpose it for our final Local Coherence Score",(Balances internal vs. synergistic health of a face),"It answers the profound question: ""How much of a department's health is its own internal state (the Ball) versus the health of its relationships (the Pillars)?""","A high ? (e.g., 0.9) reflects a philosophy of ""radical internal accountability."" A low ? (e.g., 0.2) reflects a philosophy that a department is nothing without its healthy relationships.","(0.7): This is a wise and balanced choice. It states a belief that a department is primarily responsible for its own health (70%), but is also significantly influenced by its connections (30%).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
? (Delta) The Axis Coherence Factor (Axis-Informed Blend),0.9,The constant in our final AXIS-INFORMED FACE ENERGY formula,(Blends local health with the health of the polar opposite),"It answers the ultimate question: ""How much of a domain's health is determined by its local conditions versus the health of its polar opposite (its shadow)?""","This is a profound philosophical choice. A high ? (e.g., 0.9) says, ""We primarily focus on our local reality."" A low ? (e.g., 0.2) says, ""We are profoundly and inextricably linked to our shadow; its health is our health.""",(0.5): Your decision to set this to 50/50 is a magnificent and courageous statement of non-duality. It is the most coherent and advanced choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
? (Kappa): Sensitivity Amplifier,4,"The constant in our ""amplifier"" formula for the final Face Energy",(Amplifies the final E_f score for greater responsiveness),"This is your ""emotional responsiveness"" dial. It controls how steeply the ""S-curve"" of the logistic function responds.","A low ? (e.g., 1.0) creates a gentle, forgiving system where it's hard to get a very low or very high score. It has high ""inertia."" A high ? (e.g., 5.0) creates a highly sensitive, ""high-strung"" system where small changes in real-world KPIs produce dramatic swings in the final Face Energy.","(2.0): This is a perfect starting point. It provides a good level of responsiveness without being overly volatile. If you ever feel the model is ""stuck,"" this is the first knob you should consider turning up.",,,"This table is not just a list. It is a symphony in seven movements for a twelve-piece orchestra.
