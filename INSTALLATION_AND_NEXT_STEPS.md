## 🎮 Basic Usage

### Viewing Different Faces

1. Look at the **top bar** of the helix page
2. Find the dropdown labeled "Face"
3. Click it and select any of the 12 organizational faces
4. The helix updates immediately
5. Different face = different spiral (showing that face's journey)

### Understanding What You See

| Visual Element | What It Means |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Main Spiral** | Face's primary KPI through 7 stages |
| **Bright Color** | Healthy (green = 80%+) |
| **Dark Color** | Struggling (red = <40%) |
| **5 Thin Spirals** | 5 elemental relationships |
| **7 Spheres** | Octave markers (Survival → Radiance) |
| **Spinning Motion** | Auto-rotating view (can pause) |

### Interacting with It

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Click + Drag** | Rotate view around helix |
| **Scroll Wheel** | Zoom in/out |
| **Pause Button** | Stop rotation (for static viewing) |
| **Reset Camera** | Back to default view angle |
| **Toggle Labels** | Show/hide octave numbers |
| **Select Face** | Switch to different domain |

---

## 🔍 What Each Color Means

### Green Helix (80%+)
✅ **Meaning:** This domain is healthy and coherent  
✅ **Action:** Maintain current practices  
✅ **Next:** Consider moving to next octave when ready

### Yellow Helix (60-80%)
⚠️ **Meaning:** Good progress, room for improvement  
⚠️ **Action:** Identify weak pillars (dim spirals)  
⚠️ **Next:** Strengthen element-specific weak areas

### Orange Helix (40-60%)
🚨 **Meaning:** Warning signs, significant issues  
🚨 **Action:** Investigate root causes  
🚨 **Next:** Design targeted interventions

### Red Helix (<40%)
🔴 **Meaning:** Critical - immediate attention needed  
🔴 **Action:** This is likely a bottleneck  
🔴 **Next:** Make this a priority for next quarter

### Gray/Dim (Future Octaves)
🔒 **Meaning:** Not yet accessible  
🔒 **Action:** Don't worry about these yet  
🔒 **Next:** Get current octave to 80% coherence to unlock

## 🚀 Integration with Main Dashboard

### Bidirectional Connection

The helix is **live-connected** to your main Quannex dashboard:

1. **Make Changes in Main Dashboard** (index.html)
   - Update a KPI value
   - Change an octave level
   - Adjust tuning constants

2. **Watch Changes Appear in Helix** (octave-helix-spiral.html)
   - Colors shift based on new KPI
   - Helix regenerates with new data
   - Octave locks/unlocks as levels change

3. **Test It Now:**
   - In helix: Select "Financial Capital"
   - In dashboard: Change a Financial KPI
   - Back to helix: See the helix color change in real-time! 🔄

## 📊 Use Cases

### Executive Dashboard
**Goal:** "Show me our organizational health at a glance"

1. Open helix-spiral page
2. Look at Face 1 (Financial)
3. Green spiral = financial health ✓
4. Check Face 3 (People & Culture)
5. Red spiral = people issues ⚠️
6. **Insight:** "We're financially strong but losing people"

### Department Deep-Dive
**Goal:** "How is Finance developing?"

1. Open helix
2. Select Financial face
3. Trace helix from O1 (bottom) to O7 (top)
4. Green all the way = solid development ✓
5. Red at O5-O7 = hitting innovation ceiling ⚠️
6. **Action:** "Invest in creative finance strategies"

### Problem Diagnosis
**Goal:** "Why is Operations struggling?"

1. Select Operations face
2. Observe: Red ball helix + very dim Fire pillar
3. Red = Low efficiency, Dim Fire = No energy
4. **Root cause:** "Team is burnt out"
5. **Intervention:** "Focus on workload rebalancing"

### Progress Tracking
**Goal:** "Is our transformation working?"

1. Take screenshot of helix each month
2. Track color changes (red → orange → yellow → green)
3. Watch for octave advancements (O1 → O2 → O3...)
4. Celebrate improvements visibly
5. Adjust strategies based on progress

---

## 🧪 Testing It Out

### Quick Test 1: See All 12 Faces
```
1. Open octave-helix-spiral.html
2. Use Face dropdown to cycle through all 12
3. Notice how each helix looks different
4. Some are green (healthy), some red (needs work)
```

### Quick Test 2: Real-Time Updates
```
1. Open helix page
2. Have second browser window with index.html (main dashboard)
3. In main dashboard, find a KPI
4. Change its value
5. Switch to helix → watch it update immediately 🔄
```

### Quick Test 3: Zoom & Rotate
```
1. Click and drag on helix → rotates 🔄
2. Scroll wheel → zooms in/out 🔍
3. Pause button → stops rotation
4. Reset button → returns to default view
```

---

## ⚡ Performance

### Expected Performance
- **Frame Rate:** 60 FPS on modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
- **Load Time:** <1 second per face
- **Memory:** ~50KB per face
- **Network:** ~150KB API response (gzips to ~30KB)

### If It's Slow
1. Click "Pause Animation" to stop rotation
2. Try zooming out with scroll wheel
3. Close other browser tabs
4. Try Chrome browser (most optimized)
5. Check internet connection

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Black Screen"
**Solution:**
1. Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/health`
2. Click "Reset Camera" button
3. Refresh page (F5)
4. Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Problem: "Nothing's Loading"
**Solution:**
1. Make sure backend is running in Terminal 1
2. Make sure file is served (Live Server or http-server)
3. Check both are on different ports (3001 vs 8080)

### Problem: "Helix is All One Color"
**Solution:**
- This is actually OK - means all KPIs have same coherence
- Try updating KPIs in main dashboard to see colors change

### Problem: "Can't See Labels on Octaves"
**Solution:**
1. Click "Toggle Labels" button (should say "Hide Labels" after)
2. Zoom in on the spheres
3. Labels appear near each sphere

### Problem: "Choppy Animation / Slow FPS"
**Solution:**
1. Click "Pause Animation" to stop rotation
2. Close other browser tabs
3. Reduce window size
4. Use Chrome browser
5. Check GPU acceleration in browser settings

### Still Having Issues?
1. Read `OCTAVE_HELIX_SPIRAL_GUIDE.md` - extensive troubleshooting
2. Check browser console (F12) for error messages
3. Verify backend is responding: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/octave-helix/1`

## 🌟 Advanced: For Developers

### API Access

Get raw helix data:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/octave-helix/1
```

Integrate into your own systems:
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/octave-helix/1')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data.data.ballHelix);
    console.log(data.data.pillarHelices);
  });
```

### Extending the Helix

The visualizer is designed to be extended:

```javascript
// In OctaveHelixVisualizer.js - add your own colors
getCustomColor(coherence, element) {
  // Your color logic here
}

// Or modify the helix shape
generateBallHelix(faceId, progression, currentOctave) {
  // Your custom geometry here
}
```

### Integration Points

Connect to:
- **GraphQL API** - More flexible queries
