/**
 * BreathAnalyzer - The Respiratory System of the Organization
 * 
 * This implements the 6 Breath Ratios from the Excel engine.
 * Each axis represents a fundamental polarity in organizational life:
 * - Reception (Inhale): Being, receiving, gathering energy
 * - Projection (Exhale): Doing, expressing, releasing energy
 * 
 * A healthy organization, like a healthy organism, breathes in a balanced rhythm.
 * Too much inhaling (Reception) and you become passive, stagnant.
 * Too much exhaling (Projection) and you burn out, deplete yourself.
 * 
 * The 6 Axes map to the 6 opposite face pairs of the dodecahedron.
