Harmonic Pair:,Side - Projection:,Side - Reception:,Archetype,Component,Face Energy,Final BR*,Status/Interpretation,,,"Purpose: To provide a high-level, strategic view of the six primary energetic balances within the organization. This sheet calculates the ""inhale/exhale"" dynamic for each of the six geometrically-defined harmonic pairs. It is the ""macro-scope"" that reveals the fundamental state of equilibrium or disequilibrium in the system, complementing the tactical, neighbor-to-neighbor view of the EDGE_TENSION_MAP."
