Harmonic Pair:,Archetype,Component,Face Energy,Final BR*,Status/Interpretation,,,"Purpose: To provide a high-level, strategic view of the six primary energetic balances within the organization. This sheet calculates the ""inhale/exhale"" dynamic for each of the six geometrically-defined harmonic pairs. It is the ""macro-scope"" that reveals the fundamental state of equilibrium or disequilibrium in the system, complementing the tactical, neighbor-to-neighbor view of the EDGE_TENSION_MAP."
Pair 1 (F1 ? F11),Resource Flow Axis,Projection (Exhale): Funding Pursuit,0.000,#DIV/0!,#DIV/0!,,,
,,Reception (Inhale): Capital Held,0.182,,,,,"Pair 1 (Face 1 ? 11): Financial Capital ? Funding Pipeline (The ""Resource Flow"" Axis)"
,,,,,,,,"Pair 2 (Face 2 ? 7): Intellectual Capital ? Brand & Reputation (The ""Substance & Story"" Axis)"
Pair 2 (F2 ? F7),Substance & Story Axis,Projection (Exhale): Brand Projected,0.000,#DIV/0!,#DIV/0!,,,"Pair 3 (Face 3 ? 8): Human Capital ? Core Operations (The ""Being & Doing"" Axis)"
,,Reception (Inhale): IP Embodied,0.200,,,,,"Pair 4 (Face 4 ? 9): Structural Capital ? Regenerative Flow (The ""Form & Integrity"" Axis)"
,,,,,,,,"Pair 5 (Face 5 ? 10): Market Resonance ? Foundational Values (The ""Perception & Truth"" Axis)"
Pair 3 (F3 ? F8),Being & Doing Axis,Projection (Exhale): Operations Done,1.000,0.4,Strong Exhale,,,"Pair 6 (Face 6 ? 12): Community & Partners ? Risk & Resilience (The ""Network & Fortress"" Axis)"
,,Reception (Inhale): Human Energy,0.430,,,,,
,,,,,,,,A score above 1.2 suggests the organization is receiving/holding more energy than it is projecting/acting. A score below 0.8 suggests it is projecting/acting with more energy than it is receiving/regenerating.
