## 🎯 Documentation Quality Standards

All POC documentation follows these principles:

1. **Clarity First** - No jargon without explanation
2. **Examples Always** - Every formula has a worked example
3. **Visual Aids** - Diagrams, tables, and code snippets
4. **Progressive Depth** - Start simple, layer complexity
5. **Cross-References** - Extensive linking between docs
6. **Honesty** - Acknowledge what's not done (backend-only features)

---

## 🔄 Maintenance Schedule

**Weekly:**
- Update QUICK_START.md if UI changes
- Update DEMO_GUIDE.md if new features added

**Monthly:**
- Review FILE_STRUCTURE_MAP.md for accuracy
- Update DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md (this file)

**Per Release:**
- Archive version-specific docs
- Update math docs if formulas change
- Refresh screenshots in DEMO_GUIDE.md

---

## 💡 How to Contribute Documentation

If you're adding a new feature or changing existing functionality:

1. **Update README.md** if it affects quick start
2. **Update relevant math doc** if formulas change
3. **Add worked example** for new calculations
4. **Update FILE_STRUCTURE_MAP.md** if new files added
5. **Update this index** if new docs created

**Documentation is NOT optional** - every feature must be documented.
