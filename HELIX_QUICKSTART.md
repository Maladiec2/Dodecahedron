## The Metaphor in 30 Seconds

Think of your organization as DNA:

- **Growing upward** = Evolving through 7 stages (Survival → Radiance)
- **Double helix** = Primary strength + 5 supporting elements  
- **Color** = How healthy that stage is
- **Thickness** = How coherent the metrics are

A healthy helix:
- Spirals smoothly upward ✓
- Is bright green ✓
- Has 5 visible colored strands around it ✓

## What Each Spiral Means

### Main Spiral (Thick, Colored)
"How is this organizational domain progressing through development stages?"

- Thick & green = Strong and growing
- Thin & red = Struggling

### 5 Colored Ribbons (Thin, Around main)
"What's the quality of relationships?"

- Bright = Strong connections
- Dim = Weak relationships

**Colors:**
- 🟤 Brown (Earth) = Stability
- 🔵 Blue (Water) = Emotional flow
- 🟠 Orange (Fire) = Energy & action
- 🟦 Light blue (Air) = Communication
- 🟣 Purple (Ether) = Purpose & alignment

### Pattern: Green spiral all the way up
📊 **Meaning:** Thriving in all stages  
✅ **Action:** Maintain current initiatives

### Pattern: Red spiral that turns green higher up
📊 **Meaning:** Struggled early, now strong  
✅ **Action:** Understand turnaround and replicate

### Pattern: All 5 colored spirals very dim
📊 **Meaning:** Disconnected from other domains  
✅ **Action:** Increase cross-functional collaboration

### Pattern: One colored spiral is very bright, others dim
📊 **Meaning:** Over-reliant on one element  
✅ **Action:** Develop other elements for balance

### Pattern: Oscillating between green and red

## Troubleshooting in 30 Seconds

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Black screen | Hit "Reset Camera" |
| Nothing loads | Check: Is backend running? `curl http://localhost:3001/api/health` |
| Helix is all one color | All pillars same coherence (uncommon but ok) |
| Can't see labels | Click "Toggle Labels" twice |
| Very slow/choppy | Click "Pause Animation" to stop rotation |

## That's It! 🎉

You now have a **DNA-inspired visualization of organizational consciousness evolution**. 

Welcome to the helix. It will show you the truth about your organization—including parts that might be uncomfortable.

*"The helix doesn't judge. It simply shows what is. And from seeing clearly, transformation becomes possible."* 🧬✨
